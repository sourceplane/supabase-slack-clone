# Epics

Orun-style work programs. Each epic is a folder carrying `epic.yaml` (the
declaration the platform reads: slug, key prefix, milestones with exit
criteria and task keys) beside its doc set. The pull request that adds the
folder is the adoption; the merge creates the epic in the workspace.

| Epic | Cluster | Status | What it is |
|------|---------|--------|------------|
| [`supabase-slack-clone/`](./supabase-slack-clone/) | **SL** | In progress | Supabase's Next.js Slack clone, equivalent in code and function, on Cloudflare Workers with the Supabase project provisioned and migrated by Orun — and an Orun baseline that instantiates it in one landing (SL4, `baseline-v1`) |

As-built ≠ intent: what shipped lives in each epic's `IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md`.
